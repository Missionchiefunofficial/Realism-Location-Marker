### 🏗️ Why We Moved
This repository was created due to the extensive amount of documentation and channels needed for various aspects of the RLM project. Given the scope and complexity of our operations, we determined that independence was necessary from MissionChief Unofficial while maintaining our strong partnership.

### 🤝 Our Continued Partnership
While we've established our independence, RLM remains an integral part of the MCU brand across all 24 servers. Our collaboration and shared mission to enhance MissionChief continues stronger than ever.
